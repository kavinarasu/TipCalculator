## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Having been used to mostly Java programming, it was interesting to learn the syntax of Objective-C. It was quite different. I am also surprised by the transitions in iOS programming in the past few years. It looks different from what I saw a couple of years back especially the storyboard.
